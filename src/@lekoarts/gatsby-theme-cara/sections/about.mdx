## About

> A geek from China, loving anime, music, and anything about electronics.

I love to solve problems, so I've been a collaborator of many projects.

I am fond of batch, C, C++, javascript, typescript, python, as well as programming languages that is necessary to learn.

I'm a student, a programmer trying to make things beautiful and humanity.
